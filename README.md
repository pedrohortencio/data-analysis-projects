## :oncoming_automobile: NYC Parking Violations 

A relatively simple project that I made to train my skills in EDA and plotting using Matplotlib and Seaborn. It's inspired in [this tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/learn-python-data-analytics-by-example-ny-parking-violations-e1ce1847fa2) by Nick Cox, his GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/nickdcox/learn-nyc-parking-violations/blob/main/violations.csv). 

### Data

The data used is a subset of the NYC Parking Violations, avaiable in the [NYC Open Data's website](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2021/pvqr-7yc4).

## :smile: World Happiness Report

This is a project made with the purpose of explaining Pandas for colleagues. The repository and the notebook are in Portuguese. There's code for EDA in the dataset and code explaining Pandas' main functions.

### Data 

The data used is avaiable at [The World Happiness Report's website](https://worldhappiness.report/). It's also avaiable at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness).
