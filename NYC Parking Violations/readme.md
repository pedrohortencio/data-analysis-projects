# NYC Parking Violations Project
It's a simple project to train some EDA concepts and visualizations.

It's inspired in the tasks sugested by Nick Cox in [this tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/learn-python-data-analytics-by-example-ny-parking-violations-e1ce1847fa2). While I used only the tasks and ignored the codes provided, it's an awesome tutorial.

The data used is a subset of the NYC Parking Violations, avaiable in the [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2021/pvqr-7yc4).
