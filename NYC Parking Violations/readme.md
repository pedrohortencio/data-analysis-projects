# NYC Parking Violations Project
It's a simple project to train some EDA concepts and visualizations.

It's inspired in the tasks sugested by Nick Cox in [this tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/learn-python-data-analytics-by-example-ny-parking-violations-e1ce1847fa2). His GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/nickdcox/learn-nyc-parking-violations/blob/main/violations.csv). My main goal was to focus on the visualizations and try to make beautiful graphs using Matplotlib and Seaborn. While I used only the tasks and ignored the codes provided, it's an awesome tutorial.

The data used is a subset of the NYC Parking Violations, avaiable in the [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2021/pvqr-7yc4).

The tasks that I tried to solve in this project are the following:

  1. Read the CSV file containing the NYC parking violation data. Change the ‘Issue Date’ column to a date format. Then print out the number of rows imported.
  2. Perform exploratory data analysis on the imported dataset to identify invalid data. Write code to remove the impacted rows. Then print out the number of rows remaining in the dataset.
  3. Display a simple plot that shows the number of parking violations issued for each vehicle year.
  4. List the top 5 violation codes for vehicles that are registered in states other than NY.
  5. Name the street where Hondas received the most parking violations.
  6. For vehicles that are from NY only, create a plot displaying the ratio of plate types that are not passenger, month by month.
  7. Determine whether the color of vehicles with passenger plates receiving the most violations is the same as the color of vehicles with commercial plates receiving the most violations.
  8. Display the number of registration states represented in the data and the average number of parking violations per registration state.
  9. Display the plate type that has the most parking violations for each violation code.
  10. Calculate the percentage of parking violations in each county and display in descending order.
